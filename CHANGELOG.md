# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.2]

### Fixed
- üêõ Fix a bug preventing simple setup of [basic token passthrough](docs/03_authentication_and_authorization.md#basic-token-passthrough)

## [0.3.1]

üöÄ FastApiMCP now supports MCP Authorization!

You can now add MCP-compliant OAuth configuration in a FastAPI-native way, using your existing FastAPI `Depends()` that we all know and love.

### Added
- üéâ Support for Authentication / Authorization compliant to [MCP 2025-03-26 Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization), using OAuth 2.1. (#10)
- üéâ Support passing http headers to tool calls (#82)

## [0.3.0]

üöÄ FastApiMCP now works with ASGI-transport by default.

This means the `base_url` argument is redundant, and thus has been removed.

You can still set up an explicit base URL using the `http_client` argument, and injecting your own `httpx.AsyncClient` if necessary.

### Removed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Change: Removed `base_url` argument since it's not used anymore by the MCP transport.

### Fixed
- üêõ Fix short timeout issue (#71), increasing the default timeout to 10


## [0.2.0]

### Changed
- Complete refactor from function-based API to a new class-based API with `FastApiMCP`
- Explicit separation between MCP instance creation and mounting with `mcp = FastApiMCP(app)` followed by `mcp.mount()`
- FastAPI-native approach for transport providing more flexible routing options
- Updated minimum MCP dependency to v1.6.0

### Added
- Support for deploying MCP servers separately from API service
- Support for "refreshing" with `setup_server()` when dynamically adding FastAPI routes. Fixes [Issue #19](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/19)
- Endpoint filtering capabilities through new parameters:
  - `include_operations`: Expose only specific operations by their operation IDs
  - `exclude_operations`: Expose all operations except those with specified operation IDs
  - `include_tags`: Expose only operations with specific tags
  - `exclude_tags`: Expose all operations except those with specific tags

### Fixed
- FastAPI-native approach for transport. Fixes [Issue #28](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/28)
- Numerous bugs in OpenAPI schema to tool conversion, addressing [Issue #40](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/40) and [Issue #45](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/45)

### Removed
- Function-based API (`add_mcp_server`, `create_mcp_server`, etc.)
- Custom tool support via `@mcp.tool()` decorator

## [0.1.8]

### Fixed
- Remove unneeded dependency.

## [0.1.7]

### Fixed
- [Issue #34](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/34): Fix syntax error.

## [0.1.6]

### Fixed
- [Issue #23](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/23): Hide handle_mcp_connection tool.

## [0.1.5]

### Fixed
- [Issue #25](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/25): Dynamically creating tools function so tools are useable.

## [0.1.4]

### Fixed
- [Issue #8](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues/8): Converted tools unuseable due to wrong passing of arguments.

## [0.1.3]

### Fixed
- Dependency resolution issue with `mcp` package and `pydantic-settings`

## [0.1.2]

### Changed
- Complete refactor: transformed from a code generator to a direct integration library
- Replaced the CLI-based approach with a direct API for adding MCP servers to FastAPI applications
- Integrated MCP servers now mount directly to FastAPI apps at runtime instead of generating separate code
- Simplified the API with a single `add_mcp_server` function for quick integration
- Removed code generation entirely in favor of runtime integration

### Added
- Main `add_mcp_server` function for simple MCP server integration
- Support for adding custom MCP tools alongside API-derived tools
- Improved test suite
- Manage with uv

### Removed
- CLI interface and all associated commands (generate, run, install, etc.)
- Code generation functionality

## [0.1.1] - 2024-07-03

### Fixed
- Added support for PEP 604 union type syntax (e.g., `str | None`) in FastAPI endpoints
- Improved type handling in model field generation for newer Python versions (3.10+)
- Fixed compatibility issues with modern type annotations in path parameters, query parameters, and Pydantic models

## [0.1.0] - 2024-03-08

- Core functionality for converting FastAPI applications to MCP servers
- CLI tool for generating, running, and installing MCP servers
- Automatic discovery of FastAPI endpoints
