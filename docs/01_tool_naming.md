# Tool Naming

FastAPI-MCP uses the `operation_id` from your FastAPI routes as the MCP tool names. When you don't specify an `operation_id`, FastAPI auto-generates one, but these can be cryptic.

Compare these two endpoint definitions:

```python
# Auto-generated operation_id (something like "read_user_users__user_id__get")
@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def read_user(user_id: int):
    return {"user_id": user_id}

# Explicit operation_id (tool will be named "get_user_info")
@app.get("/users/{user_id}", operation_id="get_user_info")
async def read_user(user_id: int):
    return {"user_id": user_id}
```

For clearer, more intuitive tool names, we recommend adding explicit `operation_id` parameters to your FastAPI route definitions.
